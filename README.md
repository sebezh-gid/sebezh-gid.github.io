# Simple wiki

This is a simple but fast wiki written in PHP.

- Data is stored in an SQLite database.
- Pages are rendered using [CommonMark][1], with wiki links added.
- Rendered pages are stored in the database for quick response handling.

TODO:

- Upload files.  Store them in the SQLite database also.
